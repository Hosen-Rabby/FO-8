                        <ul>
                            <li>Image Recognition → Uploading pictures, taking snapshots with the webcam, or live video is enough for the system to identify and categorize found items</li>
                            <li>Smart Matching → Owners of found items are automatically identified</li>
                            <li>Shipping and Handling → Shipment provider of your choice picks up and delivers the package</li>

                            <li>Payment → Instant electronic payment</li>
                            <li>Bookkeeping → Taking care of all associated micro-transactions</li>
                            <li>Dynamic Storage → The systems “knows” where the item can be placed right away</li>
                            <li>Paperless → Save time, waste, and clutter all thanks to new digital workflows</li>

                        <p>Automation does not only dramatically reduce the workload of staff e.g. by reducing incoming calls and emails — it also enables your Lost and Found crew to spend more time on investigating ambiguous cases, in turn increasing your return rate even further.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, automation improves the digital customer experience by allowing your customers to independently submit their lost item reports, add or edit details later on, choose their preferred delivery and payment method, pick up their found items and much more. Proactive service e.g. through automated sequenced emailing or predictive measures (such as incorporating Lost and Found into your newsletters, customer brochures, homepage etc.) go a long way in terms of service and recognizability — almost as far as being able to return the lost item! After all, customers who had the best experiences spend 140 % more than those who don’t. At the same time, 86% of customers will cease patronizing a business because of a bad experience. So make sure you choose the best solution to increase your return rate.</p>

                        <p>To make it even easier for your customers, we further recommend implementing an easily accessible and dedicated Lost and Found section on your website that can be found quickly in the heat of the moment it’s needed. Reach out to your Lost and Found Software provider if you want assistance or advice with setting up your landing page or implementing the customer form.</p>
