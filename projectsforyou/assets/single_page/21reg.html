                Enable your smartphone to connect to Lost and Found Software
                Software to take pictures.

              <p>
                Pictures are an essential tool for successful lost and found
                processes that offer many advantages. For example, you’ll save
                time usually spent rummaging through storage units in search for
                a visual of a specific item. Need to see an item with Lost and
                Found Software? Just click on it! Further, storage units needn’t
                even be local or centralized, because with the digital lost and
                found image library, place of work can be completely independent
                from place of storage.
              </p>

              <p>
                All that is necessary is a Lost and Found Software that can
                manage inventories on an image basis, as well as a device to
                take the initial picture of the found item with. Usually,
                webcams are used to take these pictures on a desktop computer or
                laptop. However, we at Lostandfoundsoftware.com take it a step
                further.
              </p>

              <div class="thedos_img">
                <img src="../img/21reg.gif" alt="Lost and found image" />
              </div>

              <p>
                Quality webcams are expensive and often impractical because of
                their natural limitations. Their cords can be too short or get
                entangled and their resolution in less than perfect conditions
                often leaves much to be desired when taking a detailed picture
                of an item or when you need a broader view, for example when
                capturing an entire suitcase on the ground. On the other hand,
                most of us already carry around a high-resolution top quality
                camera all the time!
              </p>
              <p>
                Modern smartphones have great quality and are easily accessible,
                which makes them excellent tools for any photography related
                task, even under menial lighting. That’s why
                Lostandfoundsoftware.com newest innovation enables smartphones
                to connect to the Software to take pictures. That’s right! No
                need to buy additional webcams, no cables, all you need is the
                Lost and Found Software and a smartphone. So no matter how big
                an item is you’ll be able to add a picture directly via your
                phone or tablet.
              </p>

              <div class="thedos_img">
                <img src="../img/21reg.png" alt="Lost and found image" />
              </div>

              <p>
                Moreover, the phone camera can even be used as a barcode
                scanner, further decreasing the hardware needed to run a
                professional and cost efficient Lost and Found operation. Scan a
                registered item’s barcode with your smartphone to quickly edit
                it, add it to a list, and more.
