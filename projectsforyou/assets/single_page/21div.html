                    <h2>#DIV/0! Excel Never Dies</h2>
                    <p>A Story of How and Why Excel Never Dies</p>
                    <p>First came pen and paper. Then, some four decades ago, a new form of organizing found its way into the offices and homes of avid computer aficionados: Microsoft Excel and all its equivalents. </p>

                    <div class="details">
                        <div class="thedos_img">
                            <img src="../img/21div.gif" alt="Lost and found image">
                        </div> 
                        <p>Both of these methods share a commonality — they are outdated, yet still prevalent up to this day in the Lost & Found management of nearly all organizations.</p>

                        <p>Time for a long overdue modernization that goes beyond simple repackaging, but actually makes a difference in your everyday operations and in the availability for your customers.</p>
                        <div class="thedos_img">
                            <img src="../img/21div.webp" alt="Lost and found image">
                        </div> 

                        <p>That’s how Lostandfoundsoftware.com was born. High usability coupled with the integration of newest technological innovation make the Software the most modern Lost and Found Solution worldwide. Long gone are the days when heaps of notes and files had to be waded through or mile-long formulas had to be edited in your spreadsheet. Modern solutions allow extensive functionality with the click of a button (see our feature catalog here <a href="https://docsend.com/view/s/dt8cv39wwgzb244x" class="a_underline">FEATURE LIST)</a>.</p>

                        <p>Image recognition, full item history, automated Smart Matching, return shipments, and more are at your full disposal. And your customers can submit their lost item report and even edit it from the comfort of their homes, which means even less hassle for both! You’ll have the full information on all activities within your organization readily at hand.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we at LostandFoundSoftware.com know that such a change is not entirely possible for everyone at any time. That’s why we support the good old-fashioned formats! Export all information you need for audits, auctions, specific cases, and more in XLSX or CSV spreadsheet formats with ease, so that your other programs can still use the data beyond our Software. Why do we do this? Because integration and accessibility are key!</p>
