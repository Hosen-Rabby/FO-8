                        <p>Do you already have a Lost and Found solution in place?<span class="text_bold"> Does your current provider charge your customers for every lost item</span> so that, in the end, your customers is paying for? Was your current software developed a long, long time ago, on an operating system far, far away — or feels as if it was?</p>

                        <p>Then this article is for you! Let’s walk you through the newest developments in Lost and Found technology and give you the chance to see what most of your current providers are missing.</p>

                        <p>Ask yourself: How does your provider earn money and how is their system set up? If the Lost and Found process you face doesn’t take priority over (additional) services with which revenue is generated, you can draw immediate conclusions. If you can’t, your customers surely will. They notice being charged overpriced services which ultimately gives you a bad reputation.</p>
                        <div class="side_bar">
                            <p>There are providers out there taking high fees on top of the return shipments from your clients.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Outsourcing the shipment process is a smart move on your part. But choosing a Lost and Found provider that builds their revenue model not on the needs of your organization and your customers, but on a the business case of charging your customers extra services at high prices, will backfire.</p>
