              Using Image Recognition Technology to Accelerate the Return of

              >
              is the largest global lost and found network, connecting people
              who lost items with those who have found them and helping
              companies to establish a efficient lost and found system.

              <p class="text_bold">How does it work?</p>
              <p>
                HaveItBack’s image recognition system automatically identifies
                the type of found item, color and location where the item was
                found. Even details such as brand, serial numbers or info on IDs
                can be recognized. The system learns from its mistakes and
                information can be enhanced or corrected by manually editing
                information. Multiple additional variables are taken into
                account as the system learns the patterns of consumers in real
                spaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                When, for example, taking a picture of sunglasses that are
                initially recognized as reading glasses, the system learns over
                time that the dark lenses are a unique identifying property. Or
                that it is more likely to find a snowboard than a skateboard at
                certain locations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The implemented image recognition technology uses the most
                recent “deep learning” technologies for accurately
                characterizing images. Information is verified and additional
                information is added by users to create a fast and comprehensive
                item entry. Found items are then submitted into the database
                using this rich classification information. These items are then
                immediately searched against the database and rapidly matched
                with lost items as specified by customers.

              <p>
                With the addition of image recognition technology into the Lost
                and Found Software, customer service representatives can now
                automate the registration of found item with extremely high
                quality. The customer service simply takes a picture of the
                found item for fast and automated registration into the lost and
                found database, making the item’s availability for customers
                looking for their items known. Customers can also report their
                lost items by sending an image via the appropriate online form.
                The Lost and Found Software is designed to significantly
                decrease the company’s workload, increase service capabilities,
                and at the same time improve customer satisfaction.
