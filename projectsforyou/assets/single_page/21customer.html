                    <h2>Customer Self Service — Display Images of Found Items Online</h2>
                    <div class="thedos_img">
                        <img src="../img/21cust.webp" alt="Lost and found image">
                    </div>  

                    <div class="details">
                        <p>Imagine after losing your cell, there was a way to check the website of the company you suspect to have lost it at and see all of their found phones for yourself. With images and all. Awesome, right? And indeed, it is! As a customer, you’ll quickly calm down when you see your lost property was found and is being kept safe. Then all they need to do is immediately claim the item. Done!</p>
                        <p>From a company perspective, the process is also amazing for multiple reasons. There are less calls to manage and the customer can use the unique self-service portal online. The only investigative work for staff starts when the claim process is initiated — but from our experience, Lost and Found staff are experts in positively identifying ownership of an item.</p>

                        <p class="text_bold">The Lost and Found Software Self Service Portal</p>

                        <div class="thedos_img">
                            <img src="../img/21cust.gif" alt="Lost and found image">
                        </div>  
                        
                        <p class="text_bold">Lost and Found Software Self Service Claim</p>

                        <div class="side_bar">Publishing the found entry is somewhat a philosophical question.</div>
                        <p>Yes, it brings a lot of release to the staff. But there is also some danger when it comes to detailed images being published. Often enough, the employees logging items don’t know if the picture will end up online.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, tripwires to be avoided. The customer self-service portal should refrain from publishing full names and pictures of family members as well as the chat communication on the homescreen of a smartphone, tablet or laptop online! Or even worse, police reports, IDs, or other official documents.</p>
                        <p>In this example found on the site of an alternative lost and found provider, WE had to remove the personal information to keep the customer safe:</p>
                        
                        <div class="thedos_img">
                            <img src="../img/21cut2.webp" alt="Lost and found image">
                        </div>  

                        <p>Publishing your found property online may collide with company policies and GDPR, so everybody needs to decide for themselves (and their customers) if that is a path worth pursuing. Lost and Found Software offers the best solution when it comes to customer self-service, even beyond mere online inventories. With us, you can decide to show pictures or not. You can make use of the service, but not show generic pictures instead. Customers submitting a claim or lost item report are able to update their submission at any point.</p>

                        <p>Our experts are always happy to discuss the pros and cons concerning online lost property inventories, customer self-service, or any other matter regarding Lost & Found. Reach out to us via www.lostandfoundsoftware.com</p>
