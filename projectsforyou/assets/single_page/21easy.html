                It has only been recently that Lost and Found has lost its
                status as a niche subject. Now that the topic has also come into
                the focus of large enterprises, the requirements for Lost and
                Found IT are also changing drastically. Many software products,
                which still have the niche legacy of their programming evident,
                cannot keep up with this development. One of the most prevalent
                requirements for Enterprise Software is easily establishing a
                connection with the company . To be even more specific, the most
                requested connection is with Azure Active Directory Domain
                Services.
              </p>

              <p>
                Lost and Found Software (www.lostandfoundsoftware.com) has
                always stayed ahead of the curve both in terms of innovation and
                practicability. For years, we’ve been integrating services that
                enable enterprises to run an effective User Management —
                including early compatibility with Azure AD.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a result, it’s easy to consider our Software is the most
                state-of-the-art and integrable Lost and Found Solution
                available. Our goal? Seamless integration into any enterprise
                environment and infrastructure.
              </p>

              <p>
                To stay on topic, the reason why Azure AD is so requested is due
                its ability to facilitate secure and safe Single-Sign-On (SSO)
                for staff from all devices, locations and systems. But the
                advantages are plentiful, for example, utilizing Azure AD und
                SSO can:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>increase employee and IT productivity</li>
                <li>improves security</li>
                <li>combine with Risk-Based Authentication (RBA). …</li>
                <li>reduce password fatigue</li>
                <li>streamline the user experience</li>
                <li>prevent Shadow IT</li>
                <li>increase software adoption rate</li>
              </ul>

              <p>and much, much more.</p>

              <p>
                Utilization makes it incredibly easy for a single department or
                department head to keep an overview on users authorized to
                access not only the Lost and Found Software and associated data,
                but all integrated digital services. All they need to remember
                is their company password, which, of course, follows all the
                security guidelines set forth by cyber security management.
              </p>

                Has a new employee been hired, has someone switched departments,
                or is there any other reason for an ad-hoc user needing to
                access specific software used in your company? With a service
                like Azure AD, just-in-time provisioning is not a problem at
                all.
